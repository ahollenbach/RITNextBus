# RITNextBus
RIT Next Bus is a simple bus app for the RIT community! Find out when the next bus is coming to your home location (currently supports The Province, Colony Manor, Perkins Green, and Park Point), or when it arrives at Gleason Circle.

## Current Status
Unfortunately, the app is a little out of date with the advent of the new bus system at RIT. 

This project is no longer under active development, but pull requests will be reviewed. If you would like to fork and publish your own version to the Play Store, feel free to do so!
